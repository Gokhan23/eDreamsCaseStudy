# Case Study

## Getting Started
Welcome to my case study! I had fun while doing it, I hope you will also have same feeling. On this project I used codeception framework for both api and acceptance tests.



### Prerequisites
Please be sure that `java` and `composer` installed already. 

You will also need [selenium standalone server](https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/) and [chrome driver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) 

### Installing

Run this command in the project folder:`composer install`

Then open another terminal, go to command line and give the paths for chrome driver and selenium; 

```
java -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=PATH/TO/CHROME_DRIVER -jar PATH/TO/SELENIUM.jar
```

## Task 1

To run api tests and see the results, please run this command in the project folder

```
vendor\bin\codecept run api --steps
```

To get more details add `--debug` parameter


## Task 2

Running automation tests
```

```





vendor\bin\codecept run api --steps
